## Content

The HTML `<meter>` element is used to represent a scalar value with a known range, or a fractional value. Most commonly used for displaying disk usage, blood pressure, a final grade score(90/100) or relevance of a search query result.

Example grade results:
```
<p>
  Physics test result:
  <meter min="0" max="100"
    value="81">81= Grade B
  </meter>
</p>
```
