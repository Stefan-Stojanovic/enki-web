# Editing (s, del, ins, u, mark)

## Content

The HTML `<s>`,  or the **Strikethrough Text** element is used to create a strikethrough in a text. This is usually used to specify that some text is no longer correct or relevant.

Example:
```
I have 40$ left in my account<br>
I have <s>40$</s> 35$ left in my account
```
Result:

I have 40$ left in my account

I have ~~40$~~ 35$ left in my account

**Notes:** If you want to indicate a document edit, don't use the `<s>` element, you should use the `<del>` and/or `<ins>` elements instead.

The `<s>`, as well as the `<del>`, `<ins>`, `<u>` and `<mark>` elements (mentioned below) all support global attributes. To know more about global attributes, visit the more info section at the bottom of this insight.

Next, the `<del>`, or the **Deleted Text** element is used to specify that some text has been deleted and the `<ins>`, or the **Inserted Text** element is used to indicate that some text was inserted/added to the document.

Both elements have the same 2 element-specific attributes:
  1. `cite`
  2. `datetime`
  
The `cite` attribute is used to specify the URL which explains the change. 

The `datetime` attribute is used to indicate the time of the change and the date has to be properly specified(YYMMDD) otherwise it won't parse properly and the element won't have a time stamp.

The `<del>` element is usually rendered with strikethrough text, whereas the `<ins>` is usually rendered with underlined text. 

Nevertheless, how these elements are rendered depends on the browser.

Example:
```
<del><p>Old Text</p></del>
<ins><p>New Text</p></ins>
```
Result:

~~Old Text~~

New Text

Next, the `<mark>`, or **The Mark Text element** is used to specify that some text is marked or highlighted.

The text within the `<mark>` element is usually rendered with a yellow background.

The `<mark>` element is often used to indicate a part of the text of the document that is relevant to the user's search.

Also, when `<mark>` is used within a `<q>` or `<blockquote>` element it indicates that that text is important even though it is not marked by the original author as important. This is like highlighting important text from a book with a marker/highlighter.

Last but not least, the `<u>`, or **The Unarticulated Annotation element** is used to indicate that some text should be rendered differently from the rest of the text in a way that indicated non-textual annotation. On the other hand, if you want to render text with textual annotation, you should use the `<ruby>` element. (more on `<ruby>` in a different workout) 

The content of the `<u>` element is usually rendered as underlined. Nevertheless, you can change this by using the appropriate CSS styling. (`text-decoration; underline`)

**Note: The `<u>` element used to be called the `Underline` element before when it was only used to underline text. If you wish to set some text as underline, you should not use the `<u>` element to style it but rather the appropriate CSS properties.**

Also, when using the `<u>` element you should give it a different style than underlined because users may confuse them with hyperlinks.

The `<u>` element is often used to annotate spelling errors, proper nouns and/or names in Chinese, and other annotations.

## Practice

Cross out the text "$100": 

`<p>`Try and get flights under `<tag>`$100`</tag>` $200!`</p>`

tag = ???

* s
* cross
* u
* c
* mark
* out

Display the first list item as deleted text.
Then display the third and fourth items as inserted text.

`<ol>`
  `<li>``<tag1>`Book flights`</tag1>``</li>`
  `<li>`Uber to airport`</li>`
  `<li>``<tag2>`Redeye 11:30pm.`</tag2>``</li>`
  `<li>``<tag2>`Sleep (if possible).`</tag2>``</li>`
`</ol>`

tag1 = ???
tag2 = ???

* del
* ins
* insert
* delete
* mark
* post
* d
* i

Underline the word "mispell": 

`<p>`Try not to `<tag>`mispell`</tag>` the word "misspell".`</p>`

tag = ???

* u
* under
* underline
* ul
* bottom-border

Highlight "100 laps" within the blockquote: 

`<blockquote>`
`<p>`"I just ran `<tag>`100 laps`</tag>` and I'm not even tired."`</p>`
`<cite>`Bobby the Kid`</cite>`
`</blockquote>`
`<p>`What Bobby the Kid doesn't share is that a lap in only 10 feet around that tree.`</p>`

tag = ???

* mark
* highlight
* hl
* background-color
* high

## Quiz

How much do you know about formatting text elements?

Mark the following statements that are true: 

+ Avoid using the `<u>` element where it can be confused with links. 
+ It is best to use `<ins>` together with `<del>` to properly showcase text updates to a document. 
+ The `<s>` element that defined strikethrough text was deprecated in HTML 4.01, but redefined in HTML5 as text that is no longer correct. 
+  The `<s>` and `<del>` elements visually appear the same by default, but have different semantic meaning. 
- The `<del>` tag defines elements that is being delayed during the start of an animation.
